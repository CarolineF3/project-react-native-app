# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This week's assignment was to build a mobile application with React Native.

## The problem

I decided to create a simple news app, looking at Google News App for some inspiration. I started out by creating a component for the news section, just like we did in the movie project. I continued by fetching the data and decided to present it in a FlatList component. The reason for this is that FlatLists are good for presenting big amounts of content. Then I created the NewsCard component and added some styling. I used the replace method to change the appearence of the news sources and added a function to rewrite the time and date. I also added categories for the news, when clicked upon the app fetches data based on the selected category. The last thing I added was a ActivityIndicator, showing a spinning loader.

If I had more time I would have added some extra features and an extra component for the categories. I would also have liked to come up with a better solution for changing the sources, and a different solution for rewriting the time and date (I found the current on on StackOverflow).

Technologies: API's, hooks, React, React Native, Styled Components.
